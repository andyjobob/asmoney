Download file from web
Run script import-trans.py raw_file.csv transaction_file.xlsx

import-trans.py
- Read in control information
- Using control information, read in data from raw file
  - What if there are two identical transactions (date, amount, description)?
- Read in raw data from transaction_file.xlsx
- Add new raw transactions from raw file to Raw list and to Journal list
- Perform a check to make sure all transactions that show in Raw list are also in Journal list


transaction_file.xlsx
- "Journal" Tab
- "Raw" Tab
- "Control" Tab

    - For user info only, not needed by script
  - "Raw File Info:"
    - "Header Line Number"
    - "Data Starting Line Number"
    - "Date Column"
    - "Amount Column"
    - "Description Column"
    - "Other Columns"
    - Delimeter

To Do:
1. Format for reference number needs to be a 3 digit number
2. Add some checking for discrepancies between journal list and raw list in transaction file
3. Add in additional column for comments, don't use description column for comments
4. Think of how to hanle splits, maybe current way is good enough, maybe move split column next to refno
5. Use regular expressions in key word table, figure out how to convert to raw string
